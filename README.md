# Co-op-Snake

This a 2 player snake game where players win if they have more points.

It implements features as such:
1. When one snake hits the body of another snake, it will take that much off from where it hit till the end.
2. Consists of Start, Pause, and Game over screens which have controls, exit, restart, resume buttons accordingly.
3. Includes 2 types of food (fresh apple, spoiled apple). Healthy gains a random number of score.
4. When the 2 snake heads collide, then the game will be over.

Have to implement:
1. The going away of food when not eaten for some time.
2. I want to add power ups but unsure still on how to implement it.

Thank you!!!
